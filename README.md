# üó∫Ô∏è Tourist Attraction Recommendation System

This is a fullstack web application built as a bachelor's qualification project. The goal of the project is to help users discover tourist attractions based on personalized recommendations. It addresses the challenge of information overload by suggesting relevant places using collaborative filtering techniques.

The application consists of a React.js frontend and a Node.js + MySQL backend. The recommendation engine is based on matrix factorization using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
